Keras implementation
Using the Deep Learning Algorithm Keras building model


## Dataset Location 
Can find data for this notebook on this Url link : 
```
'https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/svl8tu7cmod6tizo6rk0ke4sbuhtpdfx.csv
```

Another Data used in this above notebook is mnist, it is present in the **keras.datasets** module itself

## Models made using Keras :
- Classification model
- CNN using Kerass
- Regression model


## Software Required (Basic setup)
- IPython environment and Jupyter notebooks
- Python 3 or above versions
- Conda for package management and virtual environments

If it is not able to install and run these software on the local system
then, online [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notbook can be used to do the same.
